# Sales Forecasting

This repository contains code for sales forecasting submissions, 
showcasing my work on predictive modeling.

## Submission 23
- **File**: `submission_23.ipynb`
- **Description**: A stacking ensemble using XGBoost, LightGBM, and 
CatBoost with optimized weights, applied to a sales forecasting dataset. 
Features include lagged sales, economic indicators, and interaction terms.
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` for required Python libraries.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
https://github.com/SuprajaGuDise/sales-forecasting.git`
  2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Place the required datasets (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, 
`EconomicIndicators.csv`) in the `data` directory. Contact me for access 
to the datasets.
  4. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook submission_23.ipynb`

## Submission 21
- **File**: `submission_21.ipynb`
- **Description**: An initial sales forecasting model using linear 
regression with date-based feature engineering (to be expanded).
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` for required Python libraries.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
https://github.com/SuprajaGuDise/sales-forecasting.git`
  2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Place the required datasets (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, 
`EconomicIndicators.csv`) in the `data` directory. Contact me for access 
to the datasets.
  4. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook submission_21.ipynb`

## Best Kaggle Submission
- **File**: `kaggle_best_submission.ipynb`
- **Description**: My top-performing sales forecasting model from Kaggle, 
submitted for extra credit.
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` for required Python libraries.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
https://github.com/SuprajaGuDise/sales-forecasting.git`
  2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Place the required datasets (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, 
`EconomicIndicators.csv`) in the `data` directory. Contact me for access 
to the datasets.
  4. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook kaggle_best_submission.ipynb`
